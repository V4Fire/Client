# components/friends/data-provider

This module provides a class for working with external data providers.
The module uses the `core/data` module. To better understand the concept of data providers, refer to the documentation for this module.

```js
this.data.get({id: 10});
this.data.update({newData: 10}, {query: {id: 10}});
```

## How to include this module to your component?

By default, any component that inherited from [[iData]] has the `data` property.
But to use module methods, attach them explicitly to enable tree-shake code optimizations.
Just place the necessary import declaration within your component file.

```typescript
import iData, { component } from 'components/super/i-data/i-data';
import DataProvider, { get, deleteData } from 'components/friends/data-provider';

// Import `get` and `delete` methods
DataProvider.addToPrototype({get, delete: deleteData});

@component()
export default class bExample extends iData {}
```

## Why not to use `core/data`?

There are two reasons to use the `Data` class instead of the pure `core/data` module.

1. `Data` wraps the `core/data` module with `Async` to prevent race conditions and memory leaks.

2. `Data` is integrated with its component. For example, data for requests can be taken from the component parameters.
   Also, when executing requests, the `progress` modifier will be automatically set.

## constructor

The class constructor takes a reference to the component itself, as well as a data provider and additional parameters for it.
A provider can be specified in several ways: by its name, by its constructor, or simply by passing in an instance of the provider.

```typescript
import DataProvider from 'components/friends/data-provider';
import MyProvider from 'providers/my-provider';

import iBlock, { component, system } from 'components/super/i-block/i-block';

@component()
class bExample extends iBlock {
  @system((o) => new DataProvider(o, new MyProvider()))
  data!: Data;

  created() {
    this.data.get().then(console.log);
  }
}
```

## Methods

```js
this.url('list').get();
```

### base

Returns the base part of the URL of any provider request. Or, sets the base part of the URL for any provider request.

```js
this.base('list').get();
```

### get

Requests data from the provider by a query.

### peek

Checks the provider availability by a query.

### post

Sends data to the provider without any semantic effects.

### add

Adds new data to the provider.

### update

Updates the provider data by a query.

### delete

### dropCache

Drops the data provider cache.

### getDefaultRequestParams
