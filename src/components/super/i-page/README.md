# components/super/i-page

This module provides a super component for all page components.

## Synopsis

* The component is not used on its own. It is a superclass.

* The component sets the root `active` modifier on activation/deactivation.

* The component extends [[iData]].

* The component implements the [[iVisible]] trait.

* By default, the root tag of the component is `<div>`.

## Modifiers

See the [[iVisible]] trait and the [[iData]] component.

## Events

See the [[iVisible]] trait and the [[iData]] component.

## Basic concepts

A page component is a special component kind represents a container bound to some URL.
Why would we need these containers? In a world of "static" websites, we have URLs and HTML pages,
but nowadays, many sites transform to SPA. It means that physically we have only one HTML page, and all the rest pages are virtualized.
This is a case when we use page components. They represent virtual analogs of static HTML pages.

But there is one more case when we need the real static HTML page - it's an initialization page or the root page.
The initialization page contents the default HTML layout, like `head` and `body` tags. Also,
it loads core CSS and JS dependencies and does other initialization stuff. That's why `iPage` has two descendants:

1. [[iStaticPage]] - super component for static pages;
2. [[iDynamicPage]] - super component for dynamic or virtual pages.

So, when you want to create a new page, you should inherit from one of these, but not from  `iPage`.

## API

Also, you can see the implemented traits or the parent component.

### Props

#### [pageTitleProp]

An initial page title. Basically this title is set via `document.title`.

#### [stagePageTitles]

A dictionary of page titles (basically these titles are set via `document.title`). The dictionary values are tied
to the `stage` values. A key with the name `[[DEFAULT]]` is used by default. If a key value is defined as a function,
it will be invoked (the result will be used as a title).

```typescript
class bMyPage extends iPage {
  /** @override */
  stagePageTitles: StageTitles<this> = {
    '[[DEFAULT]]': 'Default title',
    profile: 'Profile page'
  }

  toProfile(): void {
    this.stage = 'profile';
  }
}
```

### Fields

#### pageTitle

The current page title.

```typescript
class bMyPage extends iPage {
  /** @override */
  stagePageTitles: StageTitles<this> = {
    '[[DEFAULT]]': 'Default title',
    profile: 'Profile page'
  }

  toProfile(): void {
    console.log(this.title === 'Default title');
    this.stage = 'profile';
  }
}
```

### Methods

#### scrollTo

Scrolls a page to the specified coordinates.

```typescript
class bMyPage extends iPage {
  toTop() {
    this.scrollTo({y: 0, behaviour: 'smooth'});
  }
}
```

#### scrollToProxy

A wrapped version of the `scrollTo` method. The calling cancels all previous tasks.
