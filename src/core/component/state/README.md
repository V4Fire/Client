# core/component/state

The module provides the global watchable store for all components. You could say itâ€™s like Redux, only much simpler.
Use this store to provide data of external modules to components.

## Usage

```js
import state, { watch, set, unset } from 'core/component/state';

// Online status check
console.log(state.isOnline);

// Watching the session
watch('isAuth', (value, oldValue) => {
  console.log(value, oldValue);
});

// Addin a new property to the state
set('newProp', someValue);
```

## Built-in state

V4Fire supports out of the box integration with `core/session`, `core/net` and `core/abt` modules.

### state.isAuth

The property indicates whether the session is authorized or not.

### state.isOnline

The property indicates whether there is currently an Internet connection or not.

### state.lastOnlineDate

The property indicates the date of the last Internet connection.

### state.experiments

The property refers to a list of registered AB experiments.

## API

As the default export, the module exposes a link to the store object itself.
Besides, the module exports methods to `set`/`unset` new store properties and `watch` for them changes.
To watch the store changes, it uses `core/watch`. Therefore, for detailed information about observing objects,
please refer to the documentation of this module.
