	/**
	 * The component functional mode determines whether the component should be created as a functional component.
	 * This parameter can be inherited from the parent component, but the null value is not inherited.
	 *
	 * There are several options available for this parameter:
	 *
	 * 1. If set to true, the component will be created as a functional component.
	 * 2. If set to a dictionary, the component can be created as a functional component or a regular component,
	 *    depending on the values of its props:
	 *
	 *    1. If an empty dictionary is passed, the component will always be created as a functional one.
	 *       However, you still have the option to create it like a regular component using the `v-func` directive.
	 *
	 *       ```
	 *       < b-button v-func = false
	 *       ```
	 *
	 *    2. If a dictionary with values is passed, the dictionary properties represent component props.
	 *       If the component invocation takes these props with the values that were declared within
	 *       the functional dictionary, it will be created as a functional one.
	 *       The values themselves can be represented as any value that can be encoded in JSON.
	 *       Note that you can specify multiple values for the same prop using a list of values.
	 *       Keep in mind that component type inference is a compile-time operation,
	 *       meaning you cannot depend on values from the runtime.
	 *       If you need this feature, use the `v-for` directive.
	 *
	 *    3. If set to null, all components' watchers and listeners that are directly specified in the component class
	 *       won't be attached in the case of a functional component kind.
	 *       This is useful to create superclass behavior depending on a component type.
	 *
	 * A functional component is a component that can only be rendered once from input properties.
	 * Components of this type have state and lifecycle hooks, but changing the state does not cause re-render.
	 *
	 * Usually, functional components are lighter than regular components on the first render,
	 * but avoid them if you have long animations inside a component
	 * or if you need to frequently redraw some deep structure of nested components.
	 *
	 * @default `false`
	 *
	 * @example
	 * ```typescript
	 * // `bButton` will be created as a function component
	 * // if its `dataProvider` property is equal to `false` or not specified
	 * @component({functional: {dataProvider: [undefined, false]}})
	 * class bButton extends iData {
	 *
	 * }
	 *
	 * // `bLink` will always be created as a functional component
	 * @component({functional: true})
	 * class bLink extends iData {
	 *
	 * }
	 * ```
	 *
	 * ```
	 * // We force `b-button` to create as a regular component
	 * < b-button v-func = false
	 *
	 * // Within `v-func` we can use values from the runtime
	 * < b-button v-func = foo !== bar
	 *
	 * // Explicit creation of a functional component by name
	 * < b-button-functional
	 * ```
