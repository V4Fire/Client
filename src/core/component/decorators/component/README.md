# core/component/decorators/component

The decorator creates a component based on the specified class and its properties.

```typescript
import iBlock, { component, prop } from 'super/i-block/i-block';

@component()
export default class bUser extends iBlock {
  @prop(String)
  readonly fName: string;

  @prop(String)
  readonly lName: string;
}
```

## How to create a component?

To register a new component, you need to create a simple JS class and add the `@component` decorator to it.
Also, you can pass additional parameters to this decorator. For example, in order for a component to be created as functional.

```typescript
import iBlock, { component, prop } from 'super/i-block/i-block';

@component({functional :true})
export default class bUser extends iBlock {
  @prop(String)
  readonly fName: string;

  @prop(String)
  readonly lName: string;
}
```

### How does it work?

The `@component` decorator aggregates information of the class received from other nested decorators and
with the help of reflection and forms a special structure of the [[ComponentMeta]] type.
Next, the created structure will be passed to the used component library adapter, which will create a "real" component.

## Additional options

### [name]

The name of the component we are registering.
If the name isn't specified, it will be taken from the tied class name by using reflection.
This parameter can't be inherited from the parent component.

```typescript
import iBlock, { component } from 'super/i-block/i-block';

// name == 'bExample'
@component({name: 'bExample'})
class Foo extends iBlock {

}

// name == 'bExample'
@component()
class bExample extends iBlock {

}
```

### [root = `false`]

If true, then the component is registered as the root component.
The root component is the top of components hierarchy, i.e. it contains all components in our application.

All components, even the root component, have a link to the root component.
This parameter can be inherited from the parent component.

```typescript
import iStaticPage, { component } from 'super/i-static-page/i-static-page';

@component({root: true})
class pRoot extends iStaticPage {

}
```

### [tpl = `true`]

If false, then the component will use the default loopback render function, instead of loading the own template.
This parameter is useful for components without templates, and it can be inherited from the parent component.

### [functional = `false`]

The component functional mode.
This parameter can be inherited from the parent component, but the `null` value isnâ€™t inherited.

1. If true, the component will be created as a functional component.
2. If a dictionary, the component can be created as a functional component or regular component, depending on
   values of its props:
   1. If passed an empty dictionary is passed, the component will always be created as a functional one.
      But you still have the option to create it like regular using the `v-func` directive.

   2. If passed a dictionary with values, the dictionary properties represent component props.
      If the component invocation takes these props with the values that declared within the `functional`
      dictionary, it will be created as a functional one. The values themselves can be represented as any value that
      can be encoded in JSON.

      In addition, you can specify multiple values for the same prop using a list of values
      Keep in mind that component type inference is a compile-time operation, meaning you cannot depend on values
      from the runtime. If you need this feature, then use the `v-for` directive.

3. If null, all components watchers and listeners that directly specified in the component class
   won't be attached in the case of a functional component kind. It is useful to create superclass behavior
   depending on a component type.

A functional component is a component that can only be rendered once from input properties.
Components of this type have state and lifecycle hooks, but changing the state does not cause re-render.

Usually functional components are lighter than regular components on first render,
but avoid them if you have long animations inside a component or if you need to frequently redraw some deep ones
structure of nested components.

```typescript
import iData, { component } from 'super/i-data/i-data';

// `bButton` will be created as a function component
// if its `dataProvider` property is equal to `false` or not specified
@component({functional: {dataProvider: [undefined, false]}})
class bButton extends iData {

}

// `bLink` will always be created as a functional component
@component({functional: true})
class bLink extends iData {

}
```

```
// We force `b-button` to create as a regular component
< b-button v-func = false

// Within `v-func` we can use values from the runtime
< b-button v-func = foo !== bar

// The direct invoking of a functional version of `bButton`
< b-button-functional
```

### [defaultProps = `true`]

If false, then all default values of the component input properties are ignored.
This parameter can be inherited from the parent component.

### [deprecatedProps]

A dictionary with the deprecated component props with the specified alternatives.
The keys represent deprecated props; the values represent alternatives.
This parameter can be inherited from the parent component.

```typescript
import iData, { component, prop } from 'super/i-data/i-data';

@component({deprecatedProps: {
  value: 'items'
}})

class bList extends iData {
  @prop()
  items: string[];

  // @deprecated
  @prop()
  value: string[];
}
```

### [inheritAttrs = `true`]

If true, then the component input properties that aren't registered as props
will be attached to a component node as attributes.
This parameter can be inherited from the parent component.

```typescript
import iData, { component, prop } from 'super/i-data/i-data';

@component()
class bInput extends iData {
  @prop()
  value: string = '';

  mounted() {
    console.log(this.$attrs['data-title']);
  }
}
```

```
< b-input :data-title = 'hello'
```

### [inheritMods = `true`]

If true, then the component is automatically inherited base modifiers from its parent.
This parameter can be inherited from the parent component.
