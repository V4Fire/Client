# build/webpack

This module provides options to configure Webpack. Each file in the folder has a name that matches with a Webpack option.
For instance, `/output.js` matches with `Webpack.output` or `/watch-options.js` matches with `Webpack.watchOptions`.
Notice that some modules return not a Webpack config object but a function or another kind of object structure because
it is designed to be easy to override and modify with child application layers.

All loaders are placed within the `loaders` sub-folder, and all plugins are placed within `plugins`.
The module also exposes some custom modules. These modules are placed within the `custom` sub-folder.

## Custom modules

### preconfig

This module provides a promise that will be awaited before run a Webpack process. You can override it with your app layer and
place within it some pre-config operations.

### options

This module provides a function that should return an object with the rest Webpack options, that don't have their own files.

## Webpack config

With V4Fire projects, Webpack main config exposes a promise that returns an array of config tasks. Some tasks build TypeScript/JavaScript files.
Some build style files or generates HTML files. This approach helps easily organize different ways to build an application,
like `fatHTML` (all files, images, fonts, etc., are inlined within one HTML file).
